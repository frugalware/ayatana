= Upgrading from Frugalware 1.5 to 1.6

== Preamble

The aim of this howto is to show how you can upgrade a Frugalware-1.5
(Mores) system to Frugalware-1.6 (Fermus).

== pacman-g2

The new release comes with an improved pacman-g2, you should install it
first:

----
# pacman-g2 -Sy pacman-g2
-----

//== Removing obsolete packages

//Some software has been marked as obsolete in the new release. To remove
//them:

//----
//# pacman-g2 -Rd gst-plugins-bad-alsa gst-plugins-bad-jack gst-plugins-bad-metadata
//----

== Upgrading the system

Now it's time to upgrade the system itself:

----
# pacman-g2 -Su
:: Starting local database upgrade...
----

You will be asked to replace some packages automatically.  These are
normal and you are expected to answer 'Y' to these questions (or just
hit ENTER).

After this, the list of to-be-upgraded packages is displayed. Just hit
enter and wait. Make some tea, it can take a while. :-)

== Updating config files

`pacman-g2` does not touch configuration files in case you customized
them. You should run

----
# find /etc -name '*.pacnew'
----

and update each configuration file based on the `.pacnew` version. Once
you're done with one, you should remove the `.pacnew` file.

== Updating grub configuration

We have switched our stock kernel to using an initrd by default now, but this
only effects i686 and x86_64 for now. All other archs are unchanged. If you are
running a fairly simple grub setup, you only need to run `grubconfig` after the
complete upgrade. If not, then you need to add this line to your Frugalware
menu entry in `menu.lst`. Here it is:

----
initrd (frugalware grub partition)/boot/initrd.img.xz
----

If you encounter problems with the new kernel, please file a bug report. But
before you do, check if your root partition is `/dev/sd*` and not `/dev/hd*`.
Try converting the `/dev/hd*` to `/dev/sd*` if you are having trouble.

== The reboot

Since the kernel is upgraded, too, you have to reboot your machine.

Done!
